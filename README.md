## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Issues

- When a sale with a deleted customer is updated, it will always get a new customer even if not desired!
  Similarly,
- When a purchase with a deleted supplier is updated, it will always get a new supplier even if not desired!

- When a product is deleted all it's details in the past sales and purchases are also gone from the frontend.
  The details remain in the database though.

- "Updating" product will not synchronize with frontend sales and purchases.

- Wrong feedback message displayed when incorrect email is provided for reseting password.
